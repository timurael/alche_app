## Screen status matrix

Legend: ⬜ pending · 🟡 in progress · ✅ complete · 🟢 shipped (SwiftUI) · ⊘ deliberately collapsed (not pending — see LIX-BLEND) · ↷ relocated (not standalone)

> **Truth update · 2026-04-25.** Matrix reconciled against `audit/screen-truth.md`. **19 shipped SwiftUI artifacts are SHIPPED-FINAL**: Lix chat (#26), Auth, and the 17 post-auth app screens. The earlier `—` rows for Sprint 3 + 4 were stale documentation, not stale code. The 5 onboarding rows marked ⊘ are intentional non-builds per the LIX-BLEND collapse (commit `d3884f1`) — Swift files were deleted, not pending. SupplementRecommendation and GlowScanInvitation are relocated, not standalone screens.

## Session summary — 2026-04-24

**FORGE run:** 7 agents launched (1 audit · 1 Swift implementer · 5 design), all delivered clean.

- **Audit:** 24 screens (all non-Home) with full diagnostic briefs. 3 caveats flagged in frontmatter.
- **Swift:** Direction C Home shipped to `redesign/editorial-longevity` · commit `e00054e` · `BUILD SUCCEEDED` · 4 new files, 4 modified, 2 orphans deleted.
- **Design:** 24 dialog-first mockups + 24 swift-plans across 5 groups. Cross-agent reusable components surfaced (AlcheReadCard, AlcheInterstitial, AlcheDataStrip, AlcheReadStamp) — consistent grammar across all 25 screens.
- **Deck:** `alche-app-redesign.html` — cover, preface, narrator kit, 5 groups × screen cards, Home spotlight with live commit info, 25-row implementation roadmap across 5 sprints, colophon. Print-ready A3.

**Next session — Sprint 1 (Voice):** Welcome · Profile · Discover → Swift ports using AlcheReadCard + AlcheInterstitial components. Follow swift-plan.md for each screen. Expected effort: 2 S + 2 M. See the roadmap table in the master deck.

---

## Sprint 1 — 2026-04-24 · SHIPPED

**FORGE run:** 4 agents (1 blend + 1 Lix + 1 Profile&Discover). All delivered, all builds green.

| Deliverable | Commit | Files |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Lix chat onboarding subsystem | `d3884f1` | 9 created · 4 modified · 9 deleted/moved |
| Profile dialog-first | `70437f5` | 1 created (ExtendedProfile) · 2 modified |
| Discover dialog-first | `f0b7d01` | 2 modified |

**What Lix replaces:** 8 editorial onboarding cards → 1 scripted 7-turn chat + Auth handoff. Welcome, BrandMoment, QuickScan (+VM), GoalSelection, FocusAreaReveal, OnboardingContainer/View (+VM) all deleted. SupplementRecommendation moved to Shop, GlowScanInvitation moved to GlowScan/first-run banner.

**Live verification:** simulator screenshot captured at `/tmp/alche-lix-turn1.png` — iridescent droplet mascot rendered via SwiftUI Shape + radial gradient, Turn 01/07 progress, italic lowercase Lix prompts, text input field.

**v1 limitations (flagged):**
- Lix API client uses fallback reactions only. Cloudflare Worker wiring is TODO'd — URL from UserDefaults `"alche.lix.workerURL"`.
- Discover item rows have no tap destinations (next sprint).
- Orphan views in Discover folder (ContentCardView, EventCardView, EventDetailView) — keep or delete next sprint.
- Profile retrospective read is mock-generated — swap to real BookingService / ritual-log when available.
- `bodyMode` read directly from UserDefaults in Profile VM — shared `BodyModeStore` would be cleaner.

**Next sprint — Sprint 2 (Body):** Biomarkers · Protocols · Progress · Glow scan. All Wellness features. Expected: 1 L + 3 M.

---

## Sprint 2 — 2026-04-24 · SHIPPED (same session)

**Auth redesign** also landed this session (originally Sprint 3 · Flow). Six commits in one session beyond Sprint 1:

| Deliverable | Commit | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Auth — dialog-first "signing the letter" | `6ced987` | SIGNING THE LETTER overline · italic opener (uses LixProfile.name) · 3 italic GDPR statements · Apple Sign In chrome-wrapped · USE EMAIL INSTEAD collapsed form · Encrypted · GDPR · German company footer · GDPRConsentView deleted (inline voice replaces modal) |
| Biomarkers — dialog-first | `5b1866e` | Narrated-preview state · 4 marker groups (Metabolic · Inflammation · Hormones · Cardio) · narrator interstitials · single DataSourceIndicator · out-of-range in alcheError color · BOOK BLOOD PANEL primary |
| Protocols — dialog-first | `4b043db` | Active-first read · compact italic active summary · "A few I'd put on your list" interstitial · library rows with mono overlines · 5 sample protocols |
| Progress (WellnessProgressView) — dialog-first | `c261392` | Weekly read · single curated chart (1px editorial-black path) · inline annotation on inflection · mono text row replaces segmented picker · `EditorialLineChart` private view |
| Glow scan — dialog-first | `90a26d8` | Two italic lines replace all spinners & fake camera chrome ("Hold it steady. I'll look for 30 seconds.") · appearance-based result language · qualitative strip (GLOW · HYDRATION · T-ZONE) · LOOK AGAIN primary |

**Total this session (2026-04-24):** 9 SwiftUI screens shipped to `redesign/editorial-longevity`:
Home (`e00054e`) · Lix (`d3884f1`) · Profile (`70437f5`) · Discover (`f0b7d01`) · Auth (`6ced987`) · Biomarkers (`5b1866e`) · Protocols (`4b043db`) · Progress (`c261392`) · Glow scan (`90a26d8`).

**Next sprint — Sprint 3 (Utility):** Booking · Shop · In-store · Rituals · Nutrition · Restaurants · Doctor sessions. All transactional/services. Before Sprint 3: master deck requires one more patch pass to reflect the 5 additional shipped screens (Auth + 4 wellness).

---

## Sprint 3 + 4 — 2026-04-25 · SHIPPED · Strategy 1 applied

**Strategy 1 locked:** per-screen direction selection. Each screen picks Ritual-first / Signal-first / Dialog-first based on its primary intent. Voice family preserved across all three via shared narrator kit (`AlcheReadCard`, `AlcheDataStrip`, narrator interstitial, mono primary action).

**11 commits shipped this wave:**

| Commit | Screen | Direction |
|--------|--------|:---------:|
| `6b54150` | Shop | Dialog (hybrid) |
| `5033b3f` | In-store | Ritual (GREEN audit) |
| `6c9f7b7` | Rituals | Ritual (GREEN audit) |
| `3fe87fa` | Nutrition | Signal (hybrid) |
| `2ef9831` | Restaurants | Dialog (hybrid) |
| `f9d6372` | Hormonal balance | **Signal** |
| `6648cb0` | Doctor sessions | **Dialog** |
| `3ed579e` | The map (DigitalTwin) | **Signal** |
| `e35e297` | Roadmap | **Dialog** (chapters) |
| `3b4074d` | Booking REDO | **Ritual** (replaces `ab47d6b`) |

**Booking redo highlights:** the dialog-first opener was wrong fit for transactional. Replaced with single italic next-slot hero (`Recovery / Wednesday / 15:00 · Suite 2`) + full-width `BOOK NOW →` mono primary + inline session-type filter + restrained 1-line interstitial. Slot is the moment.

**The map highlights:** "Digital Twin" → "The map" in user-facing copy. 1px anatomical silhouette path replaces concentric rings + score nodes. 2-state annotation pins (filled black for thriving, action-blue for attention). Mono cadence: `LAST RENDER · MAR 14 · NEXT · JUN 06`.

**Roadmap detox:** all fake mono metadata gone (no `VER 5.0`, no `LAT 34.05`, no `GRID REF`). 6 authored chapters from "Baseline" through "A year in, I read you again." Active chapter as italic Newsreader hero. Past compact + `DONE ✓`. Future dashed-divider muted.

**Hormonal balance:** new ViewModel (audit flagged "no VM"). 3 modes — Menstrual (28-day cycle curve, you-are-here pin), Androgen (24h cortisol, AM peak), None (default empty state with NavigationLink to Profile body-tracking). AMAB-inclusive by default.

**In-store + Rituals audit:** both **GREEN** under Strategy 1. Already Ritual-first enough. No nudge required. Audit notes saved per-screen.

**Total this session (2026-04-24/25):** **20 screens shipped** to `redesign/editorial-longevity`. Tests: 21/21 (Roadmap suite grew +3, including a fake-metadata grep guard).

**Next:** Bump to 1.2.0 build 4, archive, upload to TestFlight.

---

## Sprint 4 polish wave — 2026-04-25 · SHIPPED · Sub-screen Strategy 1 sweep

**Forge swarm:** 5 parallel agents polishing detail surfaces to match list-view register. List views shipped clean in the prior wave; detail views lagged with pre-Strategy-1 chrome (rating stars, dialog openers where Ritual fit, capsule pills).

**4 commits shipped this wave:**

| Commit | Screen(s) | Register |
|--------|-----------|:--------:|
| `eb90497` | Nutrition log entry | **Signal** |
| `56b3bc0` | Booking detail · slot picker · QR check-in | **Ritual** |
| `5f76e3e` | Restaurant detail · Dish detail | **Dialog** |
| `605dbfc` | Practitioner detail · Session detail · Session booking | **Dialog** |

**5th agent · Rituals notification:** GREEN audit (7/7 PASS), no commit needed. Cinematic modal already on-spec.

**Highlights:**
- **DoctorSessions:** rating chrome stripped from UI; italic pull-quotes attributed in mono micro-caps replace stars; complimentary session as mono benefit tag, not CTA; disclaimer staged twice (italic top + bordered warm-cream legal box bottom).
- **Booking:** Ritual voice carried through — italic next-slot hero, BOOK NOW/CHECK IN mono primary, mono inline session-type toggles in SlotPickerView replace pastel grid, QRCheckInView opens with "Show this at the door" italic hero (instruction not chrome).
- **Restaurants:** cuisine-specific curator openers; pills retired everywhere → mono LABEL · VALUE rows; DishDetailView gets "INDEPENDENTLY ESTIMATED NUTRITION · BY ALCHE" tag + 2x2 macro grid mirroring MacroDashboardView + new editorial calorie-split bar; signature dish as `· SIGNATURE` mono not stars.
- **Nutrition log entry:** Signal-first 2x2 grid extends MacroDashboardView pattern; 2pt hairline progress; selective-attention `· WATCH` tag fires only when one macro consumes ≥40% of daily goal.

**Tests:** 21/21 passing.

**Surfaced for follow-up cleanup** (flagged not fixed, walled off per scope):
- `RatingStarsView` declared in `PractitionerListView.swift` is now UI-orphaned. Safe deletion.
- `Practitioner.rating` and `Practitioner.reviewCount` model fields no longer consumed by UI. Deprecation candidates.
- `PractitionerDetailView` mock member tier hard-coded `.longevityPlus` — wire to `AppState.member.tier` once that exists.

**No version bump.** TestFlight build 4 still processing. These polishes batch with the next version cut.

---

## Sprint 1 + 2 + 5 walk — 2026-04-25 · SHIPPED · sub-screen Strategy 1 sweep, sprint by sprint

**PM-mode forge:** Sprint-by-sprint walk through every un-audited sub-view. 4 parallel agents (1 per sprint scope), audit-first protocol (GREEN / NUDGE / FULL POLISH per file), fix only what fails the audit.

**7 commits shipped this wave:**

| Commit | Sprint · Scope | Register |
|--------|----------------|:--------:|
| `cbe3bec` | 1 · Profile capsule pills (Membership + Paywall) | Dialog (mono micro-cap) |
| `b1e1aeb` | 1 · EventDetail | Dialog (italic hero, mono cadence, no pastel/sparkles) |
| `3e2aa04` | 2 · GlowScan 5 sub-views | Dialog (dark-and-quiet) |
| `d6f7f48` | 2 · Biomarkers 4 sub-views | Dialog |
| `c8e9471` | 2 · ProtocolDetail | Dialog (active-first italic Day-X-of-Y) |
| `493ee1c` | 5 · DigitalTwin 2 sub-views | Signal (RegionDetail + FutureProjection; BodyMap GREEN) |

**Audit results across 18 files:**
- **GREEN (no edit):** 7 files (BodyTracking, DeepProfile, NotificationPreferences, PersonalizationLevel, Referral, Settings, BodyMapVisualization)
- **NUDGE (1-3 surface fixes):** 7 files (Membership, Paywall, GlowScan ×5)
- **FULL POLISH (4+ drift / structural):** 6 files (EventDetail, BiologicalAgeCard, BiomarkerCategoryView, BiomarkerDetailView, ProtocolDetail, FutureProjection, RegionDetailSheet)

**Tests:** 21/21 passing.

**Highlights:**
- **Sprint 1:** EventDetail killed pastel gradient + sparkles emoji; mono LABEL · VALUE rows replaced calendar/mappin/person.2 icon scaffolding; italic Newsreader narrator opener pulled from event description.
- **Sprint 2 GlowScan:** zero clinical phrases confirmed (no "Health Score", "indicates", "diagnoses"). All 5 sub-views appearance-based ("looks well-hydrated", "looks like it could use a slower week"). Glow Score, never Health Score.
- **Sprint 2 Biomarkers + Protocols:** retired AlcheTag pills, 36pt category icons, percent-fill RangeBars, hardcoded "Beauty Glow" titles. ProtocolDetail now opens with italic Day-X-of-Y narrator + 2pt hairline progress.
- **Sprint 5 DigitalTwin:** zero "Digital Twin" in user-facing strings (folder names retained). Italic chapter copy keyed off `(region, status)` pairs reads as soft asks ("asking for a softer week") never clinical. Pin states carry the signal — raw scores no longer surfaced.

**Surfaced for follow-up cleanup** (flagged not fixed, walled off per scope):
- `BiologicalAgeCard` is currently orphaned (only its #Preview references it, no production callsite). Polished prophylactically.
- `BiomarkerCategoryView` + `BiomarkerDetailView` flagged as "Legacy state" in BiomarkerViewModel — parent dashboard no longer routes to them. Polished for when re-wired.
- `Color.alcheBeautyBg/Text/Muted/Divider/FooterBg` tokens are now unused after ProtocolDetail polish (still defined in AlcheColors).
- `GlowRecommendation` model lacks `Identifiable`/`Hashable` id — `GlowScanResultView` enumerates by `\.offset` as a workaround.

**No version bump.** TestFlight build 4 still processing.

---

## Tab bar — 2026-04-25 · SHIPPED · editorial dot indicators per deck spec

Replaces UITabBar (SF Symbols + Title Case + iOS pill on selected) with `AlcheTabBar` matching `app-redesign/shared-tokens.css` `.ios-tab-bar` exactly:

- **6×6 dot indicator** (filled `alcheEditorialBlack` active / `alcheEditorialMuted` muted)
- **Space Mono 9pt UPPERCASE label**, 1.8pt tracking (≈ 0.2em)
- **Bold weight on active label**
- **1px hairline top border** in `alcheEditorialMuted @ 25%`
- **alcheBackground** adaptive light/dark
- **No SF Symbols** consumed by the bar (Tab.icon and Tab.selectedIcon dropped)

**Tab order corrected to deck spec:** `HOME · DISCOVER · BOOK · SHOP · PROFILE` (was `Home · Book · Shop · Discover · Profile`).

**Architecture:** `TabView` + `.tabItem` replaced with `Group { switch selectedTab }` + `.safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom) { AlcheTabBar }`. System home-indicator inset preserved automatically. One tab bar instance for the whole app, NavigationStack per tab.

**Commit:** `7b8cf9a` · 4 files · −100 / +91 lines · build SUCCEEDED · 21/21 tests pass.

**Component:** `Alche/Design/Components/AlcheTabBar.swift` (66 lines, single component).

## Cleanup + Discover cards + audit intel — 2026-04-25 · 3-terminal lane

**Process change:** PM mode shifted from in-process Agent tool to **3 user-driven Claude Code terminals** in parallel + 1 inline lane. Terminals operated independently against `redesign/editorial-longevity`, committed locally, did not push. Orchestrator aggregated, gated, pushed.

**4 commits shipped this wave:**

| Commit | Lane | Scope |
|--------|------|-------|
| `867f3f7` | A · Cleanup | Drop unused `alcheBeautyBg/Text/Muted/Divider/FooterBg` tokens. Verified `alcheBeautyPrimary` still used by `AlcheProgressBar` — kept that one. |
| `a891cc6` | A · Cleanup | `ScanRecommendation` (the actual model name; `GlowRecommendation` was the colloquial flag) gets `Identifiable` + `let id = UUID()`. `GlowScanResultView` drops `\.offset` workaround. |
| `8a05fa2` | A · Cleanup | `BiologicalAgeCard` decision: **kept**, marked with one-line orphan comment at top. The 350-line file is fully Strategy 1 polished — wire from BiomarkerDashboard later, don't discard. |
| `d3a24db` | C · Discover cards | `ContentCardView` + `EventCardView` Dialog-first polish. Dropped pastel gradient hero, `AlcheTag` pills, icon rows, lock-icon tier row, sage check RSVP. Italic Newsreader 22pt titles, mono `LABEL · VALUE` cadence, `AlcheCard(.flat)` 2px borders. |

**Tests:** 21/21 passing.

### Audit intel (Lane B · read-only sweep, no commits)

4 sub-views audited against Strategy 1 voice family:

| File | Verdict | Suggested next register | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MacroDashboardView` | **GREEN** — already Signal-first canonical reference | Signal | — |
| `AuthHandoffView` | **GREEN** — single italic line on black, threshold cinematic | Ritual | — |
| `MySessionsView` | **NUDGE** — needs italic narrator opener + italic Newsreader practitioner name; AlcheCard chrome already on-spec | Dialog | S |
| `SmoothieMenuView` | **FULL POLISH** — 3 capsule pill clusters, pastel chip backgrounds, SF-Symbol category overlays, generic header, no register voice | **Ritual** (matches Booking parent `3b4074d`) | M |

### Open follow-ups (state of all flags)

**Resolved this wave:**
- ✅ Flag #1 — BiologicalAgeCard orphan → marked (`8a05fa2`)
- ✅ Flag #3 — alcheBeauty* tokens unused → deleted (`867f3f7`)
- ✅ Flag #4 — `ScanRecommendation` missing Identifiable → fixed (`a891cc6`)

**Still open from prior waves:**
- Flag #2 — `BiomarkerCategoryView` + `BiomarkerDetailView` "Legacy state" (parent dashboard not routing). Polished prophylactically; needs wire-or-delete decision.
- Flag #5 — `PractitionerDetailView` hard-coded `.longevityPlus` member tier. Wire to `AppState.member.tier` once that exists.

**New from this wave:**
- `ScanRecommendation` Hashable semantics shift — `let id = UUID()` makes two recs with identical content hash differently. No current consumer relies on cross-instance equality (only ForEach diffing), but flag if Set/Dictionary semantics get added later. Resolvable by overriding `hash(into:)` and `==` to ignore id.
- Both Discover cards (`ContentCardView`, `EventCardView`) are orphaned — no callers in the codebase. `DiscoverView` (commit `f0b7d01`) ships its own inline `itemRow`. Polished prophylactically. Wire-or-delete decision pending.
- `SmoothieMenuView` — Lane B FULL POLISH verdict. Biggest single drift in the un-audited surface; should be next-wave priority under Ritual register.
- `MySessionsView` — Lane B NUDGE verdict. ~30-min agent task to complete the DoctorSessions Dialog cluster.

**No version bump.** TestFlight build 4 still processing.

---

## Final polish wave — 2026-04-25 · SHIPPED · Lane B intel converted

**2 parallel agents** in this thread closed out the last un-audited surfaces flagged by Lane B (the read-only audit terminal).

| Commit | File | Verdict | Register |
|--------|------|---------|:--------:|
| `994d92a` | SmoothieMenuView | FULL POLISH | **Ritual** |
| `18edacb` | MySessionsView | NUDGE | **Dialog** |

**SmoothieMenuView (Ritual):** Killed all 3 capsule clusters + placeholder color tile + SF Symbol overlay. Ritual masthead opener (`THE COUNTER · ALCHE · BERLIN` mono kicker → italic two-line hero "Pair the session / with one drink."). Cards became hairline menu entries. Boost section flipped from rounded chips to text-only mono toggle rows. Confirm button matches BookingDetail primary pattern. Favorite heart removed entirely (ViewModel methods now orphaned — flagged).

**MySessionsView (Dialog):** Count-aware italic Newsreader narrator opener ("Two waiting. Three closed."). Practitioner name italic Newsreader 22pt instead of alcheBodyMedium. Surgical — status-dot + AlcheTag pair left intact (sanctioned, lower-priority).

**Tests:** 21/21 passing.

**Strategy 1 sub-screen sweep status:** all parent + sub-screen surfaces flagged in any audit are now polished or cleared. The set is closed under Strategy 1.

**Surfaced this wave:**
- `SmoothieMenuViewModel.toggleFavorite` / `isFavorite` / `favoriteSmoothies` may be orphaned (this view stopped consuming them; check other call sites before deletion).

**No version bump.** TestFlight build 4 still processing — next bump will batch all post-build-4 commits including this wave.

## Notes

### Lix blend — 2026-04-24

Lix (the droplet mascot, shipped as a working demo at `mascot-lab/lix-impl/`) takes over onboarding. The eight editorial dialog-first cards in Group 01 collapse into one scripted 7-turn chat with Lix plus a post-chat Auth handoff. Lix speaks lowercase (character voice); Alche speaks italic (narrator voice); they are the same sensibility at two registers, and the baton-pass happens on a 0.8s black-curtain interstitial between turn 7 and Auth. Mascot disappears after onboarding — Lix's droplet form survives only as the app icon. Blend decisions and Sprint 1 guidance live in `app-redesign/LIX-BLEND.md`.

Status changes:
- **Onboarding group:** 8 screens → 1 scripted chat (Lix subsystem) + 1 handoff Auth screen. Six screens merged (Welcome / BrandMoment / QuickScan / GoalSelection / FocusAreaReveal / SupplementRecommendation-onboarding-instance). GlowScanInvitation relocates out of onboarding entirely into post-auth first-run (Group 03 / Home).
- **New subsystem:** `app/Alche/Features/Onboarding/Lix/` (LixChatView + LixChatViewModel + LixMascot + LixTurns + LixSystemPrompt + LixAPIClient + LixProfile + LixMoodState) — to be implemented in Sprint 1.
- **Old onboarding Swift files:** Welcome / BrandMoment / QuickScan / GoalSelection / FocusAreaReveal views slated for deletion once Lix subsystem lands. SupplementRecommendationView retargeted to post-auth Shop/Protocols. GlowScanInvitationView moves to Home first-run. AuthView kept and repurposed as the Lix handoff.
- **Mockup:** `app-redesign/screens/lix-chat/dialog-mockup.html` — Figma-style frame, turn 3 (age → axis), with mascot, chat history, choice chips.
- **Blend doc:** `app-redesign/LIX-BLEND.md` — full decision record: scope comparison, voice reconciliation, mascot-presence decision (option a — disappears after handoff), technical architecture, master deck patches, Sprint 1 briefings.
- **Sprint 1 scope shift:** the "Welcome" agent becomes the "Lix chat" agent — effort bumps S → L. Profile and Discover agents are unaffected; Profile inherits deferred data fields (weight, height, sleep habits) as editable defaults rather than onboarding questions.

### Audit pass — 2026-04-24
All 24 remaining screens audited (Home was already complete). Each audit lives at `app-redesign/screens/{slug}/current-audit.md` and follows the standard frontmatter + structure (purpose, structure, 3 problems with Swift line cites, dialog-first transformation, available data, tone).

Two caveats logged in frontmatter:
- **Progress** — file defines `WellnessProgressView` (renamed to avoid collision with SwiftUI's `ProgressView`).
- **DoctorSessions** — feature folder has no single entry view; audit targets `PractitionerListView`, the destination of Booking's "Wellness Sessions" CTA.
- **HormonalBalance** — all data is hard-coded constants; no ViewModel/service exists yet.

### Cross-screen patterns surfaced (to inform redesign)
1. **Legacy token violations are everywhere.** Most screens still use `RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: AlcheRadii.md)` (8-12px) and filled `alchePrimary` blue buttons instead of 2px sharp + mono-underlined primaries. `.pickerStyle(.segmented)` appears in Discover and Progress. `.clipShape(Capsule())` filter pills appear in Restaurants and DoctorSessions — same design failure written twice.
2. **Voice is absent between data blocks.** Nearly every screen (Shop, Biomarkers, Digital Twin, Protocols, Progress, Nutrition, Restaurants) delivers dense information with zero Alche commentary connecting the blocks. Overlines announce sections; nothing speaks across them.
3. **Fictional mono metadata as costume.** Roadmap ("VER 5.0 · LAT 34.05 · GRID REF A-142"), Rituals ("VAR. 7 · H20-SEQ · [ ALCHE ]"), GlowScan ("S: 1/200 ISO 120"). Each pastes faux-technical tags that carry no real data. Editorial typography has been confused for editorial meaning — decoration masquerading as information.
4. **Mock-data honesty varies.** Biomarkers double-labels "Sample Data" (signs of unease). HormonalBalance carries no indicator at all. GlowScan renders numeric "64%" readouts during a mock live scan. This inconsistency will be load-bearing when real data starts arriving.
